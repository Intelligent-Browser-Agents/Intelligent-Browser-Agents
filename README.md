# Intelligent Browser Agents

*Senior Design Project — University of Central Florida*


Overview
----
Intelligent Browser Agents is a system designed to automate monotonous or repetitive user tasks inside a web browser, introducing a new way for humans to interact with computers.
By combining LLM-driven reasoning, browser automation, and a custom frontend + backend pipeline, the system transforms natural-language instructions into executable actions performed on a live browser session.

Project Motivation
---
Modern users waste significant time performing routine digital tasks (filling forms, navigating dashboards, downloading files, managing workflows).
Our goal is to create a platform where users can delegate these interactions to an intelligent agent that understands instructions, plans actions, and executes them visually and safely.
