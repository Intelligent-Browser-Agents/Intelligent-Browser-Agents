TKT-001 — Research serper.dev API - DONE

Description: Gather official docs, endpoints (search, news, images), auth method, rate limits, request/response examples, pricing.
Acceptance: Document saved in repo (docs/serper.md) with sample curl and JSON response.
Estimate: 2–4h
Dependencies: none
Priority: High

TKT-002 — Create API key management - DONE

Description: Add .env support, dotenv in backend, validation on startup, secret handling notes.
Acceptance: App reads SERPER_API_KEY from env; startup fails with clear error when missing; docs updated.
Estimate: 1h
Dependencies: TKT-001
Priority: High

TKT-003 — Implement serper.dev client module - DONE

Description: Create reusable client with methods search(query, opts), and rate-limit/retry wrapper.
Acceptance: Client returns parsed JSON; retries on 5xx; exponential backoff; unit tests cover success and retry paths.
Estimate: 4–6h
Dependencies: TKT-001, TKT-002
Priority: High

TKT-004 — Define result model and normalization - IN PROGRESS

Description: Create internal type for results (title, snippet, url, source, timestamp, relevanceScore). Normalize raw serper responses to this model.
Acceptance: Normalizer function with unit tests mapping example response to model.
Estimate: 2–3h
Dependencies: TKT-003
Priority: High

TKT-005 — Implement ranking pipeline

Description: Implement ranking function that takes normalized results and scores them using signals: recency, domain authority (simple heuristics), keyword match density, user feedback weight.
Acceptance: Ranking module with tests demonstrating score changes when signals vary; exported sortResults(results, ctx) function.
Estimate: 4–8h
Dependencies: TKT-004
Priority: High

TKT-006 — Performance & optimization pass

Description: Profile latency, add batching for multiple queries, compress responses, tune ranking heuristics, run load test.
Acceptance: Documented performance numbers; improvements validated; optional rate-limiter.
Estimate: 4–8h
Dependencies: TKT-010, TKT-011
Priority: Medium


TKT-007 — UX improvements & result optimization

Description: Implement query suggestions, autocomplete, facets (news/images), and feedback UI for thumbs-up/down to tune ranking.
Acceptance: UX features implemented incrementally; feedback stored and consumed by ranking.
Estimate: 6–12h
Dependencies: TKT-008, TKT-009
